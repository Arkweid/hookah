## Installation

Add Lefthook to your system or build it from sources.

### go

```bash
go get github.com/Arkweid/lefthook
```

### npm

```bash
npm i @arkweid/lefthook --save-dev
# or yarn:
yarn add -D @arkweid/lefthook
```

NOTE: if you install it this way you should call it with `npx` or `yarn` for all listed examples below. (for example: `lefthook install` -> `npx lefthook install`)

### Homebrew for macOS

```bash
brew install Arkweid/lefthook/lefthook
```

### snap for Ubuntu

```bash
sudo snap install --devmode lefthook
```

### AUR for Arch

You can install lefthook [package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lefthook) from AUR

Or take it from [binaries](https://github.com/Arkweid/lefthook/releases) and install manually

## Scenarios

### First time user

Initialize lefthook with the following command

```bash
lefthook install
```

It creates `lefthook.yml` in the project root directory

Register your hook (You can choose any hook from [this list](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks))
In our example it `pre-push` githook:

```bash
lefthook add pre-push
```

Describe pre-push commands in `lefthook.yml`:

```yml
pre-push: # githook name
  commands: # list of commands
    packages-audit: # command name
      run: yarn audit # command for execution
```

That's all! Now on `git push` the `yarn audit` command will be run.
If it fails the `git push` will be interrupted.

### If you already have a lefthook config file

Just initialize lefthook to make it work :)

```bash
lefthook install
```

## More options

## Use glob patterns to choose what files you want to check

```yml
# lefthook.yml

pre-commit:
  commands:
    lint:
      glob: "*.{js,ts}"
      run: yarn eslint
```

## Select specific file groups

In some cases you want to run checks only against some specific file group.
For example: you may want to run eslint for staged files only.

There are two shorthands for such situations:
`{staged_files}` - staged git files which you try to commit

`{all_files}` - all tracked files by git

```yml
# lefthook.yml

pre-commit:
  commands:
    frontend-linter:
      glob: "*.{js,ts}" # glob filter for list of files
      run: yarn eslint {staged_files} # {staged_files} - list of files
    backend-linter:
      glob: "*.{rb}" # glob filter for list of files
      exclude: "application.rb|routes.rb" # regexp filter for list of files
      run: bundle exec rubocop {all_files} # {all_files} - list of files
```

## Custom file list

Lefthook can be even more specific in selecting files.
If you want to choose all files changed locally but pushed to GitHub yet.

```yml
# lefthook.yml

pre-push:
  commands:
    frontend-style:
      files: git diff --name-only origin # custom list of files
      glob: "*.{js}"
      run: yarn stylelint {files}
```

`{files}` - shorthand for a custom list of files

## Managing scripts

If you run `lefthook add` command with `-d` flag, lefthook will create two directories where you can put scripts and reference them from `lefthook.yml` file.

Example:
Let's create `commit-msg` hook with `-d` flag

```bash
lefthook add -d commit-msg
```

This command will create `.lefthook/commit-msg` and `.lefthook-local/commit-msg` dirs.

The first one is for common project level scripts.
The second one is for personal scripts. It would be a good idea to add dir`.lefthook-local` to `.gitignore`.

Create scripts `.lefthook/commit-msg/hello.js` and `.lefthook/commit-msg/hi.rb`

```yml
# lefthook.yml

commit-msg:
  scripts:
    "hello.js":
      runner: node
    "hi.rb":
      runner: ruby
```

### Bash script example

Let's create a bash script to check commit templates `.lefthook/commit-msg/template_checker`:

```bash
INPUT_FILE=$1
START_LINE=`head -n1 $INPUT_FILE`
PATTERN="^(TICKET)-[[:digit:]]+: "
if ! [[ "$START_LINE" =~ $PATTERN ]]; then
  echo "Bad commit message, see example: TICKET-123: some text"
  exit 1
fi
```

Now we can ask lefthook to run our bash script by adding this code to
`lefthook.yml` file:

```yml
# lefthook.yml

commit-msg:
  scripts:
    "template_checker":
      runner: bash
```

When you try to commit `git commit -m "haha bad commit text"` script `template_checker` will be executed. Since commit text doesn't match the described pattern the commit process will be interrupted.

## Local config

We can use `lefthook-local.yml` as local config. Options in this file will overwrite options in `lefthook.yml`. (Don't forget to add this file to `.gitignore`)

## Skipping commands

You can skip commands by `skip` option:

```yml
# lefthook-local.yml

pre-push:
  commands:
    packages-audit:
      skip: true
```

## Skipping commands by tags

If we have a lot of commands and scripts we can tag them and run skip commands with a specific tag.

For example, if we have `lefthook.yml` like this:

```yml
pre-push:
  commands:
    packages-audit:
      tags: frontend security
      run: yarn audit
    gems-audit:
      tags: backend security
      run: bundle audit
```

You can skip commands by tags:

```yml
# lefthook-local.yml

pre-push:
  exclude_tags:
    - frontend
```

## Referencing commands from lefthook.yml

If you have the following config

```yml
# lefthook.yml

pre-commit:
  scripts:
    "good_job.js":
      runner: node
```

You can wrap it in docker runner locally:

```yml
# lefthook-local.yml

pre-commit:
  scripts:
    "good_job.js":
      runner: docker exec -it --rm <container_id_or_name> {cmd}
```

`{cmd}` - shorthand for the command from `lefthook.yml`

## Run githook group directly

```bash
lefthook run pre-commit
```

## Parallel execution

You can enable parallel execution if you want to speed up your checks.
Lets get example from [discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/.travis.yml#L77-L83) project.

```
bundle exec rubocop --parallel && \
bundle exec danger && \
yarn eslint --ext .es6 app/assets/javascripts && \
yarn eslint --ext .es6 test/javascripts && \
yarn eslint --ext .es6 plugins/**/assets/javascripts && \
yarn eslint --ext .es6 plugins/**/test/javascripts && \
yarn eslint app/assets/javascripts test/javascripts
```

Rewrite it in lefthook custom group. We call it `lint`:

```yml
# lefthook.yml

lint:
  parallel: true
  commands:
    rubocop:
      run: bundle exec rubocop --parallel
    danger:
      run: bundle exec danger
    eslint-assets:
      run: yarn eslint --ext .es6 app/assets/javascripts
    eslint-test:
      run: yarn eslint --ext .es6 test/javascripts
    eslint-plugins-assets:
      run: yarn eslint --ext .es6 plugins/**/assets/javascripts
    eslint-plugins-test:
      run: yarn eslint --ext .es6 plugins/**/test/javascripts
    eslint-assets-tests:
      run: yarn eslint app/assets/javascripts test/javascripts
```

Then call this group directly:

```
lefthook run lint
```

## Complete example

```yml
# lefthook.yml

pre-commit:
  commands:
    eslint:
      glob: "*.{js,ts}"
      run: yarn eslint {staged_files}
    rubocop:
      tags: backend style
      glob: "*.{rb}"
      exclude: "application.rb|routes.rb"
      run: bundle exec rubocop {all_files}
    govet:
      tags: backend style
      files: git ls-files -m
      glob: "*.{go}"
      run: go vet {files}

  scripts:
    "hello.js":
      runner: node
    "any.go":
      runner: go run

  parallel: true
```

```yml
# lefthook-local.yml

pre-commit:
  exclude_tags:
    - backend

  scripts:
    "hello.js":
      runner: docker exec -it --rm <container_id_or_name> {cmd}
  commands:
    govet:
      skip: true
```

## Skip lefthook execution

We can set env variable `LEFTHOOK` to zero for that

```bash
LEFTHOOK=0 git commit -am "Lefthook skipped"
```

## Skip some tags on the fly

Use LEFTHOOK_EXCLUDE={list of tags to be excluded} for that

```bash
LEFTHOOK_EXCLUDE=ruby,security git commit -am "Skip some tag checks"
```

## Capture ARGS from git in the script

Example script for `prepare-commit-msg` hook:

```bash
COMMIT_MSG_FILE=$1
COMMIT_SOURCE=$2
SHA1=$3

# ...
```

## Change directory for script files

You can do this through this config keys:

```yml
# lefthook.yml

source_dir: ".lefthook"
source_dir_local: ".lefthook-local"
```

## Version

```bash
lefthook version
```

## Uninstall

```bash
lefthook uninstall
```
